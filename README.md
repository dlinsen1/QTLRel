QTLRel
======

###Overview

QTLRel is an [R](http://www.r-project.org) package for quantitative
trait mapping in populations such as advanced intercross lines (AILs)
where relatedness among individuals should not be ignored. QTLRel
includes functions to estimate background genetic variance components,
impute missing genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan
for quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and plot the mapping
results. QTLRel also includes functions to efficiently calculate
Jacquard condensed identity coefficients.

This R package implements the methods described in

###Installation

There are two ways to install the QTLRel package for R.

The easiest way is to use the R command line. This installs the
package stored at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org). Simply enter
command <tt>install.packages("QTLRel")</tt> in R, and once the
package is successfully installed on your computer, load the package
using the command <tt>library(QTLRel)</tt>. Bear in mind, however,
that the version of the package kept on CRAN may not be completely up
to date.

Alternatively, you may download the 

to obtain the most recent version of QTLRel, download
the source code from github, and

###More information

Point to the documentation for the individual functions, and the
QTLRel tutorial for a detailed introduction.

Also point out that a very small change was made to this version of
the code to remove checks on the pedigree preventing self-mating
(selfing). Since the computation of identity coefficients assume that
the founders are *not* inbred, removing this check allows one to
define (mostly) inbred individual through iterated self-mating.

###Credits

The QTLRel package for R was originally developed by
[Riyan Cheng](http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au/borevitz-lab-people/riyan-chang)
for [Abraham Palmer's lab](http://palmerlab.org) at the
[University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu).
