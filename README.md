QTLRel
======

R package for quantitative trait mapping in populations such as advanced intercross lines where relatedness among individuals should not be ignored. QTLRel includes functions to estimate background genetic variance components, impute missing genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan for quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and plot mapping results. QTLRel also includes functions to efficiently calculate identity coefficients.
