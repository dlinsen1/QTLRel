QTLRel
======

###Overview

QTLRel is an [R](http://www.r-project.org) package for mapping
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in experimental crosses such as
advanced intercross lines (AILs) where relatedness among individuals
should not be ignored. QTLRel includes functions to estimate
background genetic variance components, impute missing genotypes,
simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan for quantitative trait loci,
and plot the mapping results. QTLRel also includes functions to
efficiently calculate Jacquard condensed identity coefficients.  Many
of these functions are similar to the functions in
[R/qtl](http://github.com/kbroman/qtl), although many of the functions
with similar names have different usage, and give different results.

This R package implements the methods described in

###Installation

There are two ways to install the QTLRel package for R.

The easiest way is to use the R command line. This installs the
package stored at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org). Simply enter
command <tt>install.packages("QTLRel")</tt> in R, and once the
package is successfully installed on your computer, load the package
using the command <tt>library(QTLRel)</tt>. Bear in mind, however,
that the version of the package kept on CRAN may not be completely up
to date.

Alternatively, you may download the source code directly from github,
and install the package from the source code. Installing QTLRel in
this way involves a couple more steps (unless you happen to have
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)), but ensures that you
have the most recent version. First, fork or clone the repository on
your computer, or download the repository as a ZIP file (github
explains how to do this). Next, build the package from the command
line on your computer (not the R shell) with the following two
commands:

    R CMD check qtlreldir
	R CMD build qtlreldir

where **qtlreldir** is the folder containing the files you downloaded
from github. Once the package is built, a file will be created with a
name something like **QTLRel_0.2-12.tar.gz**. Finally, to install the
package, run the following command in the console:

    R CMD INSTALL QTLRel_0.2-12.tar.gz

You will now be able to load the QTLRel library in R.

###More information

All functions in the QTLRel package are documented; for example, to
get a description of the scanOne function, type
<tt>help(scanOne)</tt> in R. To get a list of all the available
functions in QTLRel, type either <tt>library(help=QTLRel)</tt> or
<tt>help(package=QTLRel)</tt> in R.

There is a tutorial explaining how to use QTLRel in experimental
crosses [here](inst/doc/QTLRel_Tutorial.pdf).

The [lgsmfear package](http://github.com/pcarbo/lgsmfear) contains a
detailed working example showing how QTLRel can be used to map
quantitative trait loci in an advanced intercross line.

Note that a small change was made to this version of the code to allow
individuals in the pedigree to have one parent (which would correspond
to self-fertilization, or selfing). Calculation of the identity
coefficients assumes that the founders are *not* inbred, and removing
the requirement that an individual has two parents permits inbred
founders to be defined artificially through iterated selfing.

###Credits

The QTLRel package for R was originally developed by
[Riyan Cheng](http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au/borevitz-lab-people/riyan-chang)
for [Abraham Palmer's lab](http://palmerlab.org) at the
[University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu).
