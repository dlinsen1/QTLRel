QTLRel
======

###Overview

QTLRel is an [R](http://www.r-project.org) package for quantitative
trait mapping in populations such as advanced intercross lines (AILs)
where relatedness among individuals should not be ignored. QTLRel
includes functions to estimate background genetic variance components,
impute missing genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan
for quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and plot the mapping
results. QTLRel also includes functions to efficiently calculate
Jacquard condensed identity coefficients.

This R package implements the methods described in

###Installation

There are two ways to install the QTLRel package for R.

The easiest way is to use the R command line. This installs the
package stored at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org). Simply enter
command <tt>install.packages("QTLRel")</tt> in R, and once the
package is successfully installed on your computer, load the package
using the command <tt>library(QTLRel)</tt>. Bear in mind, however,
that the version of the package kept on CRAN may not be completely up
to date.

Alternatively, you may download the source code directly from github,
and install the package from the source code. Installing QTLRel this
way involves a couple more steps (unless you happen to have
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)), but ensures that you
have the most recent version of QTLRel. First, fork or clone the
repository on your computer, or download the repository as a ZIP file
(github explains how to do this). Next, build the package from the
command line on your computer (not the R shell) with the following two
commands:

    R CMD check qtlreldir
	R CMD build qtlreldir

where **qtlreldir** is the directory containing the files you
downloaded from github. Once the package is built, a file will be
created with a name something like **QTLRel_0.2-12.tar.gz**. To
install the package, run the following command in the console:

    R CMD INSTALL QTLRel_0.2-12.tar.gz

###More information

Point to the documentation for the individual functions, and the
QTLRel tutorial for a detailed introduction.

Also point out that a very small change was made to this version of
the code to remove checks on the pedigree preventing self-mating
(selfing). Since the computation of identity coefficients assume that
the founders are *not* inbred, removing this check allows one to
define (mostly) inbred individual through iterated self-mating.

###Credits

The QTLRel package for R was originally developed by
[Riyan Cheng](http://borevitzlab.anu.edu.au/borevitz-lab-people/riyan-chang)
for [Abraham Palmer's lab](http://palmerlab.org) at the
[University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu).
